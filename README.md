Website Portfolio Optimization Project:
View my optimized portfolio at http://phishtraveler.github.io/optimize 

 1.  Setup Github GH-Pages with the portfolio.
 2.  Ran Page Speed Insights to get a starting baseline  28/100 mobile, 30/100 desktop.
 3.  I realized many images were WAY too big, I resized them using photoshop. Images alone upped my PageSpeed score to 76/100 mbl and 89/100 desktop!
 4.  Setup Google Analytics and added my profile ID to index.html as well as the other html instances.
 5.  Removed the broken link in index.html from <link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel="stylesheet"> 
     in favor of using inline CSS.
 6.  Inlined my custom CSS into my HTML.  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;  This took my  PageSpeed score up to 92/100 mbl and 93/100 desktop!
 7.  Fixed the for loop in main.js to modify the loop variables since it was too slow.
 8.  Added async to the script <script async src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script> to not affect CSS rendering.
 8.  Replaced my resources with Google's optimized resources. This took my Page Speed score up to 94/100 mbl and 95/100 desktop
 9.  Reduced the number of Pizzas from 200 to 36.  Tip from Mark's office hours since not all 2000 are onscreen at once.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
